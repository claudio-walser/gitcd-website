Job
___
I work as a software developer/system engineer and like python most. Currently, I am epmployed at swiss national tv (Schweizerische Radio und Fernsehgesellschaft). It's one of the most intersting jobs I ever had. Large Software and Sytem landscape which makes my daily work just awesome. I still learn new things every day, even after 5 years of working there. The team is great as well, which is one of the most important things from my point of view.

Then, as a hobby, I am quite interested in security as well. I think it becomes more and more important as everthing gets smart now in times of the Internet of Things. If even your car is hackable, it becomes a problem. Fun fact, the avarage car is running 10 millions of line of code.

Languages
_________
As already said, my passion is **python**, preferably version 3. Even if i am able to write web frontends aka **HTML/CSS/JS** it's not my favorite work of choice. Right now, I also try to get along with **golang**, so far I only dislike the absence of Exceptions. And as a system engineer of course I am fit in **bash** which is, in my opinion, quite ugly, but yet very useful in daily business. In the past I also wrote some projects in **NodeJS**, which has some interesting approaches. I avoid to use Ruby and Perl, especially Perl, i hate it.

Sysadmin
________
As a sysadmin I manage debian servers and I have a strong aversion against windows. I don't like Mac OSX either but still, it's less of a pain than windows.
Also on my private machines, i prefer Ubuntu.


Spare time

In my spare time, I do alot of different things. Probably too much to practice all of it seriously.

Father
______
My main activity nowadays is defenitely being a proud father of a great little girl. As many of you know, this is very demanding but very satisfying at the same time.

Climbing
________
My wife and I used to climb alot in the past and in switzerland we have many possibilities to practice. But since we have a child now (and i gained alot of weight in the past few years) we didn't really climb anymore. I hope this might change in the future again since it teaches you so much - physically and mental.

We still like beeing in the mountains, hiking, skiing or just relaxing.

Sailing
_______
Since a few years, I am the owner of a Byte CII which is a hell lot of fun. Last year I had the most fun in wind forces around 4bft to 5bft max. Usually I sail at the Walensee (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walensee) which has a reliable wind regime. My skills aren't that good probably but this might also be the reason I like it that much.
