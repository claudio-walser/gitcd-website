Workflow
~~~~~~~~

Your productivity depends on your workflows alot. As an employe in a larger company and coding as a member of one from three teams on shared codebases is a challange some times. You need a tool supporting your workflows and not your workflows supporting a tool. Therefore gitcd might not be the right tool for you or doesent match your specific workflow perfectly. As a developer and sysadmin I personally work on many different repositories on a usual day. And each of it has different requirements. But at the same time, the workflow of all projects is quite similar. Thats the reason I even created gitcd, existing tools like gitflow/hubflow. Those just did not match our workflow quite properly or did not fullify our needs complete.


A very important thing in continuous delivery is continuous integration and reliable tests. Those should be executed automatically.
